                    <p>
                        Basically, I am fortunate with my life. But I still feel like shit and I've realised that although it's not a bad thing I am to blame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the past few months, it has been difficult to just spend time watching some series or playing some games. It's not that I am experiencing FOMO but ever since I've been to college I have realised that are so many opportunities and doors which are yet to opened by me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, whenever I am not distracted enough to realise that my time is passing, it's not the most enjoyable time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's the Sense of Purpose —&gt; which leads to fulfilment and in case either of them is missing, the day feels wasted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And lately when I was questioning myself about the reason of this unfulfillment, I realised that I have been giving myself an excuse by comparing myself to my past self.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight_underline">To give some context</span><br>
                        My freshman year of college was great. I met two people I love, had fun, and stayed away from intoxication. But that was college. Now I have a 2-month break to work on myself — and I've been comparing <em>now</em> to <em>then</em>, which made me feel worse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have been dreading to go back to college to rediscover my Sense of Purpose eventually leading to me being fulfilled. But that's just wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because what I am doing is looking at the past and ruining the current moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason the past year in college was great was : <br>
                        a) I didn't have a frame of reference <br>
                        b) I didn't have a choice but to make the best of the moment and live with no regrets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that's what I should apply to this current moment but in this scenario, I do have a frame of reference. This is my house, this is one of my rooms. I have made certain memories here and I have developed a certain mindset about myself, here. And today that's exactly what's holding me back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think so that's why it's recommended to change the position of your study table or your sitting after an interval of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the point being irrespective of the location, irrespective of my previous mindset that I have developed in that location, each and every moment is unique and crying about not having the perfect circumstance is just stupid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No one is going to hand over a sense of purpose to you without taking a significant portion of your freedom. And me being me, I hate that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight_underline">So, what do I have to do?</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simple.<br>
                        a) Realise that you have no choice but to make the best of the current circumstance.<br>
                        b) Recognise your unfair advantage.<br>
                        c) Create something that solves a problem or gives yourself a sense of purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So that's my final cent on this. I hope that next time anyone feels the same way, this helps.
