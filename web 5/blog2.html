                <article class="blog-content">
                    <p>[PS: I officially joined Instagram on 8th March 2025.]</p>
                    <p>
                        There are two major reasons why I refuse to join Instagram :
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>
                        1.The Comparison Trap: 
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        It’s hard to ignore the <span class="highlight_glow">pang of jealousy</span> that creeps in when you see people you
                         know living their <span class="highlight_glow">"best life"</span> on Instagram—whether it’s them attending the
                          concert of your favorite artist, being part of a social gathering you weren’t
                           invited to or even achieving goals that you never knew you wanted to achieve. 
                           These posts often create a <span class="highlight_underline">false sense of perfection</span>.</p>
                           <p>We start measuring our own lives against these highlight reels/stories, even though deep down,
                            we know social media is a curated version of reality. Still, it 
                            <span class="highlight_underline"> triggers feelings of inadequacy and the
                                 painful sense of missing out</span>. This constant
                              comparison <span class="highlight_glow">chips away at your self-worth</span>, leaving you feeling 
                              <span class="highlight_underline">less confident and more isolated</span>
                               , even if you logically know it's not the full picture.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>
                        2.The REEL Addiction: 
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Then there’s the other side of the coin: <span class="highlight_glow">the addictive pull
                             of Instagram's never-ending stream of Reels.</span> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're one of the lucky few who can resist 
                        this time sink, good for you. But for many, it’s <span class="highlight_glow">a black hole for productivity. 
                        </p></span>
                    <p>
                        You scroll mindlessly, promising yourself you'll get back to work in "<span class="highlight_glow">just five minutes</span>"
                        . But those five minutes turn into an hour, then two, and before you 
                         know it, the day slips away. This procrastination <span class="highlight_underline">slowly erodes your ability to take action</span>.
                         It drains your motivation, causing you to delay important tasks, 
                         which <span class="highlight_underline">further damages your self-esteem and sense of accomplishment.</span>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>The Exception:</h2>
                    <p>
                        That said, Life isn’t binary — at least I refuse to believe it is.
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe that there is one valid reason for 
                        creating a personal Instagram account: 
                        <span class="highlight_allout">building your brand</span>.
                           I’m not talking about just being a model
                           or influencer. Rather, <span class="highlight_underline">if you have a craft or passion</span>
                            — whether you're an F1 driver, a social 
                           activist, an environmentalist, an artist, or 
                           a musician — and you <span class="highlight_underline">want to showcase your dedication to that specific pursuit</span>,
                            then Instagram can undoubtedly be a powerful tool.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this case, you’re using the platform <span class="highlight_allout">not as a consumer but rather as a creator</span>
                            <span class="highlight_glow">with a clear purpose</span>. The number of times 
                            you’ll mindlessly open Instagram out of 
                            boredom will be far fewer compared to the 
                            average user. And with that sense of purpose,
                             you're not only mostly <span class="highlight_underline">immune to the comparison trap</span> but also
                             <span class="highlight_underline"> shielded from the addictive pull of Reels</span>. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            <span class="highlight_allout">You’re on the platform for a reason</span> and that 
                            makes all the difference.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    <h2>
                        Conclusion: 
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        While Instagram has its downsides, like the traps
                         of comparison and mindless scrolling, <span class="highlight_glow">the real key lies in how you use it</span>.
                          If you’re approaching it with a clear purpose — whether to 
                          build a brand, showcase a passion, or to contribute to society — Instagram can be a powerful tool 
                          rather than a source of distraction.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          <span class="highlight_underline">Ultimately, it’s about being intentional</span>. 
                          <span class="highlight_glow">Use the platform to serve your goals,
                             not to diminish your self-worth. </span>
